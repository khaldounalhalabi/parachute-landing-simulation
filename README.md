# Parachute Landing Simulation 🪂

This is a **3D parachute landing simulation** built using **JavaScript** and **Three.js** as part of a **school project
**. The simulation applies physics-based motion to a falling soldier who can deploy a parachute mid-air to control
descent.

## ✨ Features

- **Realistic physics-based simulation** of free-fall and parachute descent.
- **3D graphics** powered by **Three.js**.
- **Keyboard controls** to trigger actions:
    - `Spacebar` → Jump from the airplane.
    - `O` → Deploy the parachute.
- **Dynamic environment** including an airplane, parachute, and soldier model.
- **Adjustable parameters** for descent rate and forces.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**
- **Three.js**
- **Vite** (for development & bundling)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/parachute-landing-simulation.git
cd parachute-landing-simulation
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Simulation

```shell
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server. Open the provided localhost URL in your browser to view the simulation.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Start the simulation by running npm run dev.
- Press Spacebar to jump from the airplane.
- Press O to deploy the parachute mid-air.
- Watch the soldier land safely on the ground (if the parachute is deployed in time!).

## ⚠️ Missing Models & Textures

Currently, some 3D models and textures are missing from the repository. This will be fixed soon, and an update will be
pushed to include them. Until then, you may experience missing visual elements in the simulation.
